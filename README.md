# Data-Structures
Implementation of functionality of data structures; used for testing algorithm/data structure functions.

There are inconsistencies that are on purpose (e.g., Stack.pop() returns the popped Node, but Queue.dequeue() doesn't return anything); I just wanted to demonstrate different ways of implementation.

All structures are jammed into one .cpp file for easy compiling (I enjoy dropping it into ideone.)
