# Data-Structures
Implementation of functionality of data structures; used for testing algorithm/data structure functions.

There are inconsistencies that are on purpose (e.g., Stack.pop() returns the popped Node, but Queue.dequeue() doesn't return anything); I just wanted to demonstrate different ways of implementation.

Then there might be some styling inconsistencies.  Sorry, I'm just settling down on a preferred method.
